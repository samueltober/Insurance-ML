# Tree-based Machine Learning for Insurance Frequency Modelling
This github is a suplemental R repository to the bachelor thesis: "Tree-Based Statistical Learning Models with Applications in Insurance Pricing", which can be found at: link. Below is a description of all the R functions in this repository.

* [Frequency modelling](Frequency_model.R) - contains code for a K-fold cross-validation scheme using GBM, note that the GBM easily can be replaced by any other model.
* [Plotting](Plotting.R) - contains code to generate variable importance plots, partial dependency plots, cross-validation plots and histograms of the data set used in the article. Note that all the plotting functionality relies on having the models stored in your R workspace.
